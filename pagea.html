	<h3>Where It began</h3>
	<div> Boxing was introduced In the ancient Olympic games of the 7th 
	century. Leather thongs were used as the boxing gloves for the 
	competitors. Over the years the gloves have evolved. 
	Hover over the image of the vintage 
	boxing gloves to compare them to a modern pair.</div>
	<h3>Important Rules</h3>
	<div> There is no hitting below the belt, holding, kicking
	pushing, and headbutting allowed. You cannot puch your 
	opponent in the back or neck. If a boxer is knocked out of 
	the ring he has 20 seconds to get back in the ring. Only the 
	referee can stop a match. A boxer that is knocked down has ten
	seconds to get up before being considered knocked out. Rounds 
	last for 3 minutes. In professional
	boxing matches can go up to 12 rounds.</div>
	<h3>Scoring System</h3>
	<div>The scoring system in boxing is known as the ten point 
	system. In this system, Judges score each boxer on a ten point 
	system. Most of the time boxers will receive a 10 or a 9, with 
	the most dominant boxer receiving a 10. If a boxer is knocked down 
	a point is lost. Judges can also take away points for intentional
	or unintentional fouls. This usually only happens after a warning. The main thing judges tend to look for are Effective Aggression, how well a boxer is able to enforce his will on his opponent, defense, 
	and Clean punches ( punches that are not blocked or deflected)..</div>
