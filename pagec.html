<h2>Pressure Fighter</h2>

<img id=image1 src="images/manny.jpg" alt="Manny Pacquiao">
<p> Pressure boxers focus primarily on overwhelming 
their opponents with many combinations. This style's 
overwhelming nature often leads to opponents being kept 
in a defensive state for most of the match. Boxing is centered 
around offense, for this reason, this style scores huge points 
with judges do to its offense-oriented mindset. However, throwing 
many punches and staying on the offensive takes a major toll on a 
boxer's stamina. Due to this boxers of this style require much more 
conditioning and endurance in order to be efficient. (Hover over the

<h2>Out-boxer</h2>
<img id=image2 src="images/floyd1.jpg" alt="Floyd Mayweather Jr.">
<p> An outboxer is very much the opposite of a 
pressure boxer. An outboxer focuses more so on a 
defensive long ranged style and precise and accurate punches. 
Technique and decision making are paramount to a outboxer.Due to 
thier defensive style these boxers tend to lack in power and 
knock-out potential, leading many of thier wins coming from decision.

<h2>Slugger</h2>
<img id=image3 src="images/hitman.jpeg" alt="Ricky Hatton">
<p>	While an out boxer may focus on strategy and finesse, 
a slugger does the opposite and focuses on strength and brute force. 
These boxers often get in close to deal their most damaging blows. 
This style is can also be referred to as a brawler. 
It should be noted that while these boxers use brute force to 
win their matches they are not mindless. Cornering their opponents 
and getting in range to deal the most amount 
of damage they can requires technique and planning.

<h2>Counter Puncher</h2>
<img id=image4 src="images/rigondeaux.jpg" alt="Rigondeaux">
<p> As the name suggests a counter-puncher focuses on countering there opponents punches. These boxers are known for their high skill, 
talent, and technique. Fighting these boxers is both annoying and 
painful as counter punches can deal devastating damage due to their 
ability to use the opponents forward momentum against them. 
The downside of this style is its reactive nature. Setting up their 
counterpunches require them to wait for their opponent to act 
meaning they rarely initiate offense and can be overwhelmed.

<h2>Boxer-Puncher</h2>
<img id=image5 src="images/mike.jpg" alt="Mike Tyson">
<p> The Boxer-Puncher is the Jack of all trades,
switching between pressure fighter and out-boxer styles a 
Boxer-Puncher usually likes to work their way in on the opponent. 
They are often looking to capitalize on mistakes pouring on the 
heat when they know the other boxer is hurt. Due to this, they are 
very difficult to deal with when 
they are on the offensive but typically lack defense since 
they often only focus on offense.</p>
